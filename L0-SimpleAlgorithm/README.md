## FIBONACCI NUMBERS

The Fibonacci numbers are very useful for introducing algorithms, so before we continue, here is a short introduction to Fibonacci numbers.

The Fibonacci numbers are named after a 13th century Italian mathematician known as Fibonacci.

The two first Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and the next Fibonacci number is always the sum of the two previous numbers, so we get 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

## The Code

Fibonacci has been implemented in 3 styles:

- **Loop Method:** iterative using a for loop.  
  - Time Complexity: O(n)

- **Recursion Method:** naive recursion.  
  - Time Complexity: O(2^n)

- **Tail Recursion Method:** recursion using helper parameters to carry results.  
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
