# Arrays

An array is a data structure used to store multiple elements.

Arrays are used by many algorithms.

Arrays are indexed, meaning that each element in the array has an index, a number that says where in the array the element is located. The first element in an array can be accessed at index 0.

## Example: Find Minimum and Maximum in an Array

For this lesson, the **minimum** and **maximum** element algorithms have been implemented.  
These examples demonstrate how to traverse an array and access its elements.
