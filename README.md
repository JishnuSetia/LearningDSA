## Features

* **Multi-language Implementations:** C, Python, Java, and JavaScript.
* **Step-by-step Examples:** Each topic has practical code examples.
* **Ready for Interviews:** Covers all common DSA concepts tested in coding interviews.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JishnuSetia/LearningDSA.git
cd LearningDSA
```

2. Explore algorithms by topic and language.

3. Run code easily using the `run.sh` script:

- Examples:

```bash
./run.sh L0-SimpleAlgorithm/main.c
./run.sh L0-SimpleAlgorithm/Fibo.java
./run.sh L0-SimpleAlgorithm/script.js
./run.sh L0-SimpleAlgorithm/example.py
```

4. The script supports **C, Python, Java, and JavaScript** and will automatically:

- Compile and run C programs
- Execute Python, Java, and JS scripts
- Show execution output with clear headers and exit codes

## Goals

* Master **Data Structures and Algorithms** in multiple languages.
* Build **problem-solving skills** and prepare for coding interviews.
* Gain practical experience implementing algorithms efficiently.
