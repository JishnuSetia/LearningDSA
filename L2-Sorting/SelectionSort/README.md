# SELECTION SORT

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and moving it to the beginning.

## How it works

1. Start at the first element (index 0).
2. Find the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion.
3. Swap it with the element at the current index.
4. Move to the next index and repeat until the array is sorted.

* Time Complexity: `O(n²)` in all cases (best, average, worst)

## The Code

Selection Sort has been implemented in 4 languages:

* **Java**: `SelectionSort.java`
* **C**: `main.c`
* **JavaScript**: `main.js`
* **Python**: `main.py`
